# Brigade Infrastructure

Right now, this repo just exists so that we can have a GitHub project board to coordinate tasks relating to the smoothness of user experience and onboarding between various brigade infrastructure tools: Slack, Discourse, the Project Index Statusboard, the CfA website, and Google Drive.  Our goal is to make it easier for a person who is new to the national network (whether they are new to CfA entirely or have only been involved in their local brigade up to this point) to figure out how to plug in.
